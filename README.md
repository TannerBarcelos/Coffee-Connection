### The Tech Stack

<br>

- Coffee Connection is built with the MERN stack. I leverage sessions for user authentication and authorization and React on the frontend to render all the content. For the backend I am using Node/ExpressJS with a Object-Data Mapper Mongoose to hook into MongoDB for my data-store
- I am using all custom SASS layout / design with some Semantic-UI mixin for the Cards.

### Want to give it a run?

- Clone the project into a directory of your choice. Once open, you can simply enter the command below and it will spin up a local backend and frontend development server in one command with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)

```bash
npm run dev
```

- This app is open source so if you would like to contribute submit a pull-request!

# Happy Coding !
